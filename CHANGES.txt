0.6.0: 2010-04-13
=================

- 0.6.0 relies on libspatialindex 1.5.0+.
- Intersection and nearest methods return iterators over results instead of
  lists.
- Number of results for nearest() defaults to 1.
- 0.6.0 relies on libspatialindex 1.5.0.
- libsidx C library of 0.5.0 removed and included in libspatialindex
- objects="raw" to return the object sent in (for speed).
- .count() method to return the intersection count without the overhead 
  of returning a list.
- Improved bulk loading performance
- Supposedly no memory leaks :)
- Many other performance tweaks (see docs).
- Bulk loader supports interleaved coordinates
- Leaf queries.  You can return the box and ids of the leaf nodes of the index.  
  Useful for visualization, etc.
- Many more docstrings, sphinx docs, etc


0.5.0: 2009-08-XX
=================

- Complete refactoring to use libsidx - a C API for libspatialindex.  The 
  code is now ctypes over libsidx, and a number of new features are now available 
  as a result of this refactoring.
  
  * ability to store pickles within the index (clustered index)
  * ability to use custom extension names for disk-based indexes
  * ability to modify many index parameters at instantiation time
  * storage of point data reduced by a factor of 4
  * bulk loading of indexes at instantiation time
  * ability to quickly return the bounds of the entire index
  * ability to return the bounds of index entries
  * much better windows support 
  * libspatialindex 1.4.0 required.
